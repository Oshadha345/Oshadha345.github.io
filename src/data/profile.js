  name: "Oshadha Samarakoon",
  title: "AI/ML Researcher & EEE Undergraduate",
  tagline: "Explore bravely, build deliberately, understand deeply.",
  
  shortBio: "I'm an Electrical and Electronic Engineering undergraduate driven by a fascination for the deep structures that govern reality—systems, intelligence, consciousness, and the physics that hold everything together. I blend engineering, mathematics, AI research, and philosophical curiosity.",
  
  fullBio: `I don't follow conventional paths; I prefer to dismantle ideas, rebuild them from first principles, and search for the hidden layers most people overlook. My work blends engineering, mathematics, AI research, and philosophical curiosity, always pushing toward a future where understanding and innovation go hand in hand.

I believe that real progress comes from questioning the frame itself, not just thinking inside or outside it. Currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at the University of Peradeniya's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, maintaining a 3.7/4.0 GPA while actively engaging in cutting-edge AI/ML research.

My research spans state-space models (Mamba architectures) for solar irradiance prediction, computer vision applications in renewable energy, and remote sensing using deep learning. I'm also deeply interested in the philosophy of mind, consciousness studies, and the mathematical foundations underlying intelligence.

When I'm not coding or researching, you'll find me diving into books, participating in competitive programming competitions, or exploring the intersections of technology and philosophy.`,
